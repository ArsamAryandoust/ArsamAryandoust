Hi ðŸ‘‹, I explore how Artificial Intelligence can help us solve climate change. Check out my doctoral thesis on [Artificial Intelligence for the renewable energy transition](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/641426) and my full [list of publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bC7mSGUAAAAJ&hl) for more on this topic. I am always happy to chat about new methods and ideas, so feel free to [reach out](https://lids.mit.edu/people/research-staff). See for example how we [enhance spatio-temporal electric load forecasts using less data with active deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00552-x),

how we create [city-scale car traffic and parking density maps from Uber Movement travel time data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0159-6),

or how we [unify machine learning tasks and datasets for enhancing renewable energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06876).
