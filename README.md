Hi ðŸ‘‹, I explore how Artificial Intelligence can help us solve climate change. Check out my doctoral thesis on [Artificial Intelligence for the renewable energy transition](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/641426) and my full [list of publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bC7mSGUAAAAJ&hl) for more on this topic. I am always happy to chat about new methods and ideas, so feel free to [reach out](https://www.mit.edu/~arsam).
